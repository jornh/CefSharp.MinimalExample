CefSharp.MinimalExample
=======================

Minimal example of how the CefSharp library can be used


Please note: `MinimalExample` is minimal :smile:

So far: [![58810adc2c0a4701b0a692d36afb01f7 MyGet Build Status](https://www.myget.org/BuildSource/Badge/58810adc2c0a4701b0a692d36afb01f7?identifier=893ecb6b-7c0f-489a-a882-061073273a69)](https://www.myget.org/)

Due to no x64/ in the `cef.redist` package which the build server understandably thinks it should try to build it as ... well red is the first step en red-green-refactur so not to bad so far
